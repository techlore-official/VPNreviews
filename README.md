***Transparent, open source VPN tools for your privacy & security üîê***

Our goal is to give users the tools to make educated decisions on what makes a VPN 'good', and what they realistically accomplish. To view our full VPN ToolKit [Click Here](https://techlore.tech/vpn)

## How to Contribute
#### VPN Chart
Our VPN Chart is open source and we want every VPN on it. To make this possible, we encourage individuals (or VPN companies) to:
* Look for mistakes, please find & report them!
* Add missing data
* Add new services

[The chart](https://github.com/techlore/VPN-reviews/blob/master/VPNchart.csv) is in a CSV format. It's recommended to copy/paste the header row and go through each column to fill in the necessary data. Feel free to refer to other VPNs for help. If you don't know what something means, just leave it blank! You can submit just a single data point if you wanted--this is a community project. The chart will improve with time to be more intuitive and easier to use. We thank our early contributors in dealing with its limitations.

#### Spread the Word
There aren't many legitimate VPN resources on the internet. In fact, many resources pay huge sums of money for SEO to outrank legitimate resources. To help combat this, we ask users to share this project as much as possible. Word of mouth is how we rely on spreading this project to as many people as possible.

## Affiliate Plans & Sponsorships
*This readme is brought to you by NordVPN...* ***NOT***

Sponsorships can be fine, but they've led to massive amounts of misinformation, fake and/or biased reviews, & other...questionable practices.

***We have not and will never be sponsored by a VPN provider. Period.***

We implement an entirely opt-in, affiliate model with extremely limited services we feel comfortable having plans with. There will always be a clearly labeled standard & affiliate link for users to know where they're located, and these never influence the chart.

## What Happened to VPN Reviews?
**As of February 5, 2022 our review protocol is being phased out. We no longer feel individual VPN reviews are beneficial to our audience. Rather than individually reviewing every VPN service, we've opted for a chart with objective data points so users can visually see where each service excels. If you want your data on the chart, please contribute to the chart.**
